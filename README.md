<h1>Data Science and Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Stack</h2>
<p>A stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear,ordered sequence of elements.Elements are inserted or removed from the same end.
You can use stacks in back and forward button in a web browser.
Undo and Redo functionality in text editors.
Memory management in computer programming.

Properties of tuples
<ul>
<li>
Linear data structure 
Restricted access
Dynamic size
<li>
</ul>

<h2>Tuple</h2>
<p>A tuple is an ordered sequence of values. You can use a Tuple to store the latitude and longitude of your home.
The same Tuple type can be used to store the coordinates of other locations.

Advantages
<ul>
<li>
Tuples make the code more safe incase of accidental modification.
Tuples are more memory efficient.
Tuples can be used in a dictionary.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Queues</h2>
<p>Queues are used for storing and managing data in a specific order.
It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A large amount of data can be managed efficiently with ease.Tuples are more memory efficient.
Tuples can be used in a dictionary.
Queues are useful when a particular service is used by multiple consumers.
</li>
</ul>
